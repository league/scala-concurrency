A Pattern Language of Concurrency
New York Scala Enthusiasts

Monday 27 June 2011
Meetup Headquarters

http://www.meetup.com/ny-scala/events/19772691/

Chat servers and ping-pong demos are fine starting points, but where
to go from there?

We'll have 2-3 speakers to showing various concurrent design patterns,
with real Scala code. Anyone claiming to possess silver bullets will
be shot with regular bullets.

30 minute talks:

 * Chris League - Experiments structuring concurrent computations as
   networks of actors.

   Code https://github.com/league/scala-concurrency

 * Nathan Hamblen - Experience managing non-blocking I/O channels in
   immutable collections, with the help of @volatile and good old
   synchronized().

 * Jim Powers - Using Scala 2.9's parallel collections effectively.
